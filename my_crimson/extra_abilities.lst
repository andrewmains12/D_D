Family Honor	KEY:Family Honor ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait	DESC:Someone you know and love was accused of murder. A supposed eyewitness account from a local fisherman seemed to be enough to seal the case, but the accused had enough alibis that sentencing wasn’t immediate. Someone confronted the fisherman and discovered he was intimidated into providing false witness and forced into planting the murder weapon by the actual murderer—a local crimelord. His thugs killed the fisherman before he could recant his testimony. Although this removed the key witness and resulted in the accused being set free, the stigma was enough to badly damage his reputation. If you can find the crimelord, you’re sure you can find evidence that ties him to the murder and can clear the accused’s name.	BONUS:SKILL|Bluff|2					BENEFIT:Family Honor: The person framed was a family member, perhaps a father or brother. You managed to trick the fisherman into revealing the truth with your skilled tongue, and thus gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks.
